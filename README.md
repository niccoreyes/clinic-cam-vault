## Live Demo

## The Story Behind Clinic Cam Vault

In ophthalmology clinics, clinical documentation often involves recording videos of patients' eyes. However, using traditional camera apps or software like OBS can be cumbersome. Clinicians frequently have to juggle multiple windows, navigate through file explorers, and switch between apps just to show a patient their recording. This disrupts the flow of care and adds unnecessary complexity.

Clinic Cam Vault was created to solve this problem by offering a seamless, offline-compatible web application that allows clinicians to record videos directly in the browser, tag them with patient information, and manage recordings without ever leaving the app or exposing files online unless explicitly chosen.

The goal is to streamline the camera documentation process into one integrated experience that runs entirely in the browser, including secure local storage of videos. This means clinicians can focus on patient care without worrying about technical distractions or privacy concerns.

This project is actively under development, with ongoing improvements to the user interface and features to make the experience even smoother.
